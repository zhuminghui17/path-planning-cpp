## Path Planning

- Step 1 Read in a graph representation from a file.
- Step 2 Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a start to goal node.
- Step 3 Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path when there are obstacles.
- Step 4 Use the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path when there are obstacles.

### Step 1

- [x] Node Class
- [x] Graph Class
- [x] read file and match nodes and edges
- [x] ID starts from zero
- [ ] node type is unsigned integer. ?
- [x] Print it
- [ ] test cases and invalid stuffs
can have zeros nodes

every file needs "$node" "$edge"
format wrong, bug

 The node type is unsigned integer.?
### Step 2

- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm



multiple $nodes, $edges
