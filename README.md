## Path Planning

- Step 1 Read in a graph representation from a file.
- Step 2 Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a start to goal node.
- Step 3 Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path when there are obstacles.
- Step 4 Use the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path when there are obstacles.

### Step 1

- [x] Point Class
    - [x] distanceFrom()
- [ ] Graph Class
    - [x] addNode
    - [ ] addEdge
    - [ ] operator<<.
