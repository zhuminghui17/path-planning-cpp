# Path Planning with C++

Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A* algorithms and obstacle detection algorithms in C++ to find the shortest path, utilizing data structures such as Priority Queue and HashMap in the C++ STL for optimized graph traversal.

# Next Step
* Make it user-interactive, where users can input the number of points and obstcales, it will randomly generate the graph and implement the path planning algorithm. 
* Make a GUI which displays the graph and dynamically demonstrates the path searching process.
